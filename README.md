What is this?
=============
This is a git repository to store files used to develop a homegrown access
control system for [091 Labs](http://www.091labs.com/), a hackerspace in 
Galway, Ireland.

What we're hoping to do
-----------------------
Ultimately, this will be an RFID-based access control system based largely on
a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org), with some ancillary bits and bobs.
